    "## OptiGuide for Supply Chain Optimization: System Design Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The original system design for OptiGuide, tailored for supply chain optimization, is presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user asks a problem one, the encoder accepts the problem ① and formulates it as a contextual learning (ICL) problem ② of the LLM. The LLM then generates code ③ to answer this question. Safeguards check the validity of the code and abort the operation if an error occurs; Otherwise, the guard feeds the code to an application-specific component ④, such as a database engine or optimization solution (depending on the query). This component processes the code and generates the results, which are recorded in a file ⑤. We note that getting the final result may involve multiple iterations (2 to 5) where the query is automatically refined until the desired output is reached. Finally, the output log of the component is fed back into the LLM ⑥. LLM analyzes the log and generates a human-readable answer ⑦, which is then sent back to the user ⑧.\n",

    "![](./optiguidefile/new_design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of this multi-agent design with autogen:\n",
    "- Collaborative Problem Solving: The collaboration among the user proxy agent and the assistant agents fosters a cooperative problem-solving environment. The agents can share information and knowledge, allowing them to complement each other's abilities and collectively arrive at better solutions. On the other hand, the Safeguard acts as a virtual adversarial checker, which can perform another safety check pass on the generated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity: The division of tasks into separate agents promotes modularity in the system. Each agent can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, simplifying the overall development process and facilitating code management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory Management: The OptiGuide agent's role in maintaining memory related to user interactions is crucial. The memory retention allows the agents to have context about a user's prior questions, making the decision-making process more informed and context-aware.\n",
